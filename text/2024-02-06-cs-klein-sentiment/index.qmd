Coming in a day!

```{r}
#Given the following data frame, how do I create a new column called “3” that contains the sum of 1 and 2? You may only use $, not [[. What makes 1, 2, and 3 challenging as variable names?

df <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))
names(df) <- c(1, 2)
df$`3` <- df$`1` + df$`2`
```

```{r}
#In the following code, how much memory does y occupy?
x <- runif(1e6)
y <- list(x, x, x)
```

```{r}
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```

```{r}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
l2 <- l1

ref(l1, l2)
```
