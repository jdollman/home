At Stony Brook I've been the 'instructor of record' for Introduction to Statistics (undergraduate and graduate) and Experiments in Political Science (undergraduate). In addition to those bureaucratically sanctioned courses, I also taught an introductory math camp to incoming PhD students and, along with my esteemed former colleague [Pei-Hsun Hsieh](https://phsieh.com/), I co-taught a weekly introduction to R during the Fall 2019 semester to graduate students from sundry social sciences.

Currently, materials are only available for the math camp. The rest seem to have been apprehended by federal authorities from a Mar-a-Lago bathroom. A [flyer](seven-ds.pdf) from the Introduction to R course survives, however.
