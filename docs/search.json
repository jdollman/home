    "text": "Hello and welcome to this extremely minimally designed space. Sorry I didn’t make it nice for you – you deserve better.\nSince this site’s raison d’être is professional, I should say a word or two about me qua wage laborer. Currently, I’m employed by Stony Brook University as a graduate student in political science. There I’m working on my dissertation under the advisement of Michael Peress. If there’s (still) no tab on this site for ‘Research’ that means that its contents are still under lock and key. At Stony Brook I’ve had the pleasure of taking courses with such luminaries as Stanley Feldman, Andy Delton, Yanna Krupnikov, and Vittorio Merola. I’ve also taught a few ‘methods’ courses (coding in R, statistics, math camp, experiments in political science). Immediately before landing on the Ye Longe Isle of Bagels & Hockey Fanatics, I taught English for a few years in Lima, Peru. And before that, I triple majored in philosophy, psychology, and German at the University of Arkansas (with a year spent at Karl-Franzens Universität in Graz, Austria)."

In addition to those bureaucratically sanctioned courses, I also taught an introductory math camp to incoming PhD students and, along with my esteemed former colleague Pei-Hsun Hsieh, I co-taught a weekly introduction to R during the Fall 2019 semester to graduate students from sundry social sciences.\nCurrently, materials are only available for the math camp. The rest seem to have been apprehended by federal authorities from a Mar-a-Lago bathroom. A flyer from the Introduction to R course survives, however."

    "text": "Very basic question here. What has eigenvectors/eigenvalues? A: Matrices (transformations)\nJust glancing at the transformation matrix \\[\\textbf A = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 4 & 8 \\end{bmatrix}\\], which vectors are going to stay on the line they span after the transformation \\(\\textbf A \\boldsymbol v\\)?\nAnswer: Vectors of the form \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & j\\end{bmatrix}\\)\nWhat is an eigenvector’s eigenvalue? An eigenvalue is the factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or squished. It’s the eigenvector’s associated scalar.1\nHow can you interpret the eigenvector of a 3D transformation? A: This is a bit of a trick question. If its eigenvalue is 1, then that eigenvector is the axis of rotation of the transformation. Remember that rotations in the 2D plane didn’t have (real) eigenvalues!\nWhat is the equation that unites eigenvectors with eigenvalues? \\(\\textbf A \\vec{v} = \\lambda \\vec{v}\\)\nHow do you transform \\(\\textbf A \\vec{v} = \\lambda \\vec{v}\\) so that the left-hand side is matrix-vector multiplication (the right side already is!)? You insert an identity matrix! \\(\\textbf A \\vec{v} = \\lambda \\boldsymbol I_n\\vec{v}\\)\nWhat equation do you set up to solve for \\(\\vec{v} \\text{ and } \\lambda\\)? Hint: start with the result of the previous problem.\n\\(\\textbf A \\vec{v} = \\lambda \\boldsymbol I_n\\vec{v} \\\\ \\textbf A \\vec{v} - \\lambda \\boldsymbol I_n\\vec{v} = \\vec 0 \\\\ (\\textbf A - \\lambda \\boldsymbol I_n)\\vec{v} =\\vec 0\\)\nThen, since \\(\\vec{v} \\neq \\vec 0\\), we know that \\(\\text{det}(\\textbf A - \\lambda \\boldsymbol I_n) = 0\\).\nXXX Geometrically, why do we want \\(\\text{det}(\\textbf A - \\lambda \\boldsymbol I_n) = 0\\)? ???\nWhat’s a shear? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping\n[There’s definitely stuff missing here]\nWhat’s the “eigen interpretation” of a diagonal matrix? Its columns are where the basis vectors end up. Importantly, they end up on the line that they originally spanned. This means that the diagonal entries (scalars) are the eigenvalues (the amount by which the basis vector is scaled).\nShow/prove to your own satisfaction why it is the case that the eigenvectors of a diagonal matrix are basis vectors and their eigenvalues are the diagonal entries of the matrix.\nWhat’s an eigenbasis?\nWhen can you (not) get an eigenbasis?\nHow do you get a matrix into its eigenbasis?\nHow does an eigenbasis help you exponentiate a matrix?\nTODO: Insert Markov example\nThere’s the problem to do at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nIn fact, I really think eigenvalue should have been “eigenscalar,” but that’s what they get for asking this Eigen guy to name it.↩︎"

A: You can go to the video at 5:40 to check yourself. A: First, you have to remember that it’s a quadratic approximation, so your template is \\(\\cos x \\approx c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2\\). If you had forgotten that (or don’t see that), note that \\(1 - \\frac{x^2}2 = 1 + 0 x + - \\frac 12 x\\), meaning that \\(c_0 = 1,\\ c_1 = 0,\\ c_2 = -\\frac 12\\). Your goal here is to ‘fit’ the \\(c_i\\) parameters (a fancy machine-learning inspired way of saying that you’re choosing the \\(c_i\\) values that give you the best approximation). Now, you need \\(\\cos 0 = c_0 + c_1 (0) + c_2 (0)^2 \\\\ 1 = c_0 + 0 + 0\\), so \\(c_0 = 1\\). Then, to ensure that the rate of change (slope, derivative) of the approximation is the same as the rate of change of cosine, you take the derivatives of both: $ - x = c_1 + 2 c_2 x$ and evaluate at zero: $ - = c_1 + 2 c_2 \\ 0 = c_1$. So now we have \\(c_0 = 1,\\ c_1 = 0\\). We also want their second derivatives to be the same at zero, so we take the second derivatives of both: \\(- \\cos x = 2 c_2\\) and evaluate at zero: \\(- \\cos 0 = 2 c_2 \\\\ -1 = 2c_2\\), meaning that \\(c_2 = - \\frac 12\\)\nQ: Generally, how do you make an approximation better? Can you think of any caveats? A: Increasing the degree of the polynomial makes the approximation better, usually.\nThere are two ways to understand the ‘caveat’ tag. First, remember that the value of approximations generally is that they’re simpler, so having a high degree polynomial might defeat the purpose of the approximation enterprise. The other caveat has to do with divergent series (see below).\nQ: GS has an \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) (where \\(X\\) is the input and \\(Y\\) is the output) diagram for summarizing what Taylor polynomials are all about. From that vague clue, can you remember what it is? A: They take in derivative information at a point and give back approximations of the function’s output.\nQ: Find the linear approximation of \\(f(x) = 5 - 2x + 3x^2\\) A: As a note, if you’ve taken calculus before you’ll remember that the \\(3x^2\\) term ‘dominates’ the output as \\(x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty\\), meaning that the linear approximation will be extremely bad (we lopped off the most relevant part!!). That’s why it’s important to occasionally remember that we’re approximating outputs for values near the expansion point, which in this case is zero. And notice that around 0, \\(3x^2\\), the term that ends up dominating, is actually ‘less relevant’ because squaring a value \\(x\\) where \\(|x| < 1\\) and when \\(|x| << 1\\), \\(|x^2| << |x|\\)\nQ: Find the quadratic approximation of \\(f(x) = 5 - 2x + 3x^2\\) A: The first thing you’d ideally have remembered is that, as your polynomial expansions get higher in degree, the lower degree part doesn’t change. So [insert previous bit] You could also notice that \\(5 - 2x + 3x^2\\) is already in the ‘template’ form of \\(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2\\). There was no work to do! The general point is that an nth degree Taylor polynomial ‘approximation’ of an nth degree polynomial function is just the original function\nQ: Here’s a harder one. Find the cubic approximation of \\(\\ln x\\) A:\nConvergence Divergence."

It “generalize[s] calculus beyond functions whose inputs and output are simply numbers.” That is, functions whose inputs and outputs are real numbers.\nCan you complete this phrase from the video, I’d encourage you not think of this derivative-as-slope idea as being the definition of the derivative; instead think of the derivative as … ‘… as asking how sensitive is the function to tiny nudges around a given input.’ Interestingly he then goes on to show a picture of mapping numbers on a number line to their corresponding number on a different number line … seems like reals to reals!\nQ: In your own words, what’s this ‘stretch/squish’ understanding of the derivative? A: ‘If you take a small area around a point on a number line \\([x_0 -a, x_0 + a]\\), the derivative of at that point is about how much those points are being stretched (if \\(|f'(x_0)| > 1\\)) or squished (if \\(|f'(x_0)| < 1\\)) on the ’output’ number line. So, they become spread out if the function stretches inputs around \\(x_0\\) and they become contracted if the derivative is\nQ: In this numberline-to-numberline ‘transformational view’ hat does it look like to have a derivative of zero? A: It looks as if the points just stack atop each other. Note: he does x^2, you should do x^3 + 3x (wait, how does that never have a derivative of zero?!)\nWhat are the two kinds of fixed points?

Though it was imparted to incoming political science PhD students (a rather specific crowd), its fundamental nature makes it useful to anyone entering a statistics, econometrics, or machine learning program (or anyone who wants to learn the calculus and/or linear algebra necessary for such programs).\nEven before I created this, the number of math camp-y introductions to calculus and linear algebra was already vast beyond comprehension. At this point anyone who creates their own introduction is, whether they know it or not, pursuing some type of vanity project. So I decided to pursue a slightly less vain project and piggyback on Grant Sanderson’s wonderful 3Blue1Brown series of videos on calculus and linear algebra. His videos are both beautiful and profound. The only pedagogical issue is that there are neither questions nor problem sets associated with the material. Call me as old-fashioned as muddled sugar, bitters and whiskey, but it’s practice that makes perfect. So, under the ‘Content’ header below, there is a page for each of Sanderson’s videos that contains a mix of comprehension questions and problems to solve with pen and paper. As one says in this type of situation, any mistakes in the material below are my own responsibility and, in all likelihood, Grant Sanderson doesn’t even know about this material."

For my fellow Americans who went through mediocre middle and high schools, they’ll bring back memories of lazy “comprehension questions” handed out by teachers after a reading. Nevertheless, if you’ve ever consciously experienced the voraciousness of forgetfulness, you’ll know that even the basics aren’t immune. If you really want to learn the material, I’d recommend scheduling a reminder and going over the material again a week after the first time.1\nSo, en resumen, there are2 three sections in each of the following documents: comprehension questions reviewing the video, ‘canonical’ questions that anyone who says they’ve studied this subject would be expected to know, and a ‘going further’ section that is idiosyncratic to each video.\n\nCalculus\n\nThe essence of calculus*\nThe paradox of the derivative*\nDerivatives formulas through geometry*\nVisualizing the chain rule and product rule*\nWhat’s so special about Euler’s number \\(e\\)*\nImplicit differentiation\nLimits, L’Hopital, epsilon-delta definition\nIntegration and the fundamental theorem of calculus*\nWhat does area have to do with slope?*\nHigher order derivatives\nTaylor series*\nThe other way to visualize derivatives\n\n\n\nLinear Algebra\n\nThe essence of linear algebra*\nVectors*\nLinear combinations, span, and basis vectors*\nLinear transformations and matrices*\nMatrix multiplication*\nThree-dimensional linear transformations*\nThe determinant*\nInverse matrices, column space and null space*\nNonsquare matrices\nDot products and duality*\nCross Products\nCross products as transformations\nCramer’s rule\nChange of basis\nEigenvectors and eigenvalues*\nA quick trick for computing eigenvalues*\nAbstract vector spaces\n\n\n\nSelected Precalculus\nPrecalculus is an expansive grab bag of subjects (too many!) and it sounds inglorious (not sexy!).

They contain everything you could want from an online course: videos of the lectures, recitation sessions, problem sets, and exams.
