## Answers

1. Symmetries

:::

Cutting a cirlce into concentric rings. You flatten them out. What shape do you get and what's its area?

You'd get trapezoids, but we'll represent them as rectangles. Their length is $2\pi r_i$ where $r_i$ is the radius of the i^th^ concentric circle and its with is $dr$.

We'll discover integrals, derivatives, and the fact that these two are opposites.
