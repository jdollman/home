Functions are another type of vector?
Yes!
  - You can add two functions together! (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
  - You can scale a function by a real number! (2f)(x) = 2f(x)
  - Derivatives are an example of a transformation (a.k.a. linear operator)
    - But what does it mean for a transformation to be *linear* (additivity and scaling -- there's a screenshot)
    - He shows how this works for the derivative!
  
Woah, basis functions!
