The three perspectives on what we mean by "vector"

Let's ignore the mathematician's perspective

An arrow inside a coordinate system

tail on the origin -- that's unlike the physics perspective

This is something hinted at in the video. How would you go from the vector-as-arrow perspective to the vector-as-list-of-numbers perspective?

The arrow's "tip" lies at a certain coordinate in $n$-space. That **coordinate** can be represented as a list of numbers.

What's the difference between $\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 9 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}$?
The former is a *point* and the latter is a *vector*.

Vector addition.

The diagonal of the parallelogram (he doesn't cover that -- but you should)

Vector multiplication (scalar-vector multiplication)

k > 1, 0 < k < 1
Scaling a vector, scalar

GS says that, in LA, numbers go around scaling so much that it's commong to use "number" and "scalar" interchangeably. Just to be clear, though the contents ... maybe ... IDK.

I don't think he mentions anything about vector notation!
