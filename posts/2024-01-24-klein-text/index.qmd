## Welcome

This page is a small (and incomplete!) labor of love.^[This page is currently in progress and will be updated until January 29th, 2024. I'm working on it as much as I can job-permitting.] For now, it's part of an application to be the researcher for the Ezra Klein Show. With time it will morph into a much longer and more thorough guided tour how to use text analysis to understand politics and society.

## Interviewing Style

Before even looking at the content of the episodes, before looking at what words are said, sentiments are expressed and topics are covered, we can look at volume of speaking.

We can also compare this distribution of how much Ezra speaks as interviewer to how much other interviewers speak. After all, it's hard to really feel what the numbers in the graph above mean without comparing them to the relative talkativeness of other interviewers. Below is a comparison of Ezra with two other interviewers, both of whom have had Ezra on as a guest on their programs: Rob Wiblin (80,000 Hours) and Tyler Cowen (Conversations with Tyler).

This is a little more interesting, I think. 

My hypothesis before crunching these data was that Tyler was speak the least (and it wouldn't be close), then Rob, then Ezra. And that turned out to be right.^[I sadly didn't preregister these hypotheses, so you have to reason to believe me.] After all, Ezra speaks quiet a bit because people tune into Ezra's show _in order to listen to Ezra_. Though Tyler's show does have "Tyler" in the name, he frequently announces that his interviews are the interviews that _he_ wants, not what the listeners might want. And his listener-be-damned approach often results in quick questions and abrupt topic changes. The 80,000 Hours podcast has this intermediate position where Rob often positions himself as a listener might and restates what the speaker said, gives the conventional wisdom against which the interviewee can react, and ask follow-up questions.

## Ezra's Words

Alright, so what does this ingenious interviewer from Irvine actually talk about? Among the ways of answering that question, one is to just look at the words he uses. The simplest way of operationalizing 'words used' is to look at "unigrams," which result from splitting the unstructured text at every whitespace^[You can also split on other delimiters as well. Various non-alphanumeric characters would do], making each whitespace-separated unit into a row in a dataframe, and counting how many rows each token (word) appears in that resulting dataframe. Ezra's result is below.^[For the following two graphs, I recommend right-clicking them and opening in a new window. The proportions are terrible on this page. My sincerest aesthetic apologies.]

<br/>

But you can also get slighly more sophisticated and look at contiguous words. So, instead of splitting at every whitespace, you split at every second or third whitespace. The nice thing about that is you start to see phrases, turns of speech. For example, if you were curious why "people," "lot," and" bit" appear in the unigrams, the following two panels give you your answer.

The Ezra Klein Show fan will also be pleased to see Ezra's pat phrases for parts of his podcast: "final question", "books you'd recommend," and "email [is] ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com." I'm not sure if seeing these phrases is *interesting*, but they are nice proofs of concept for the method.

Here is something that's more interesting. We can also look at how he uses words differentially. Why would that be useful? Well, just looking at the words he uses might tell us that he's a guy with a show that covers topics X, Y, and Z that use the words associated with those topics.^[If we wanted a topic analysis we'd head down to the last section of this page!] One way we can "control for" topic is to contrast Ezra's words with those of his guest. Abstractly, the idea is that if person A and B are talking about subject S, the words that differentiate A and B are *not* going to be those that generically describe subject S. Rather, they will be the words idiosyncratically associated with each interlocutor.

[Forthcoming plot, Jan 25]

We can also compare the words of the Ezra Klein Show to the words used in introductory political science textbooks. The idea of such an analysis would be to ask, "When Ezra talks politics, which topics (proxied by words) does he dedicate space to than an introduction to politics? Which topics does he spend less time one?" From these results one could hope to find out something about which aspects of politics Ezra finds interesting and important, and which less so. Unfortunately, I carried out the analysis and the result is below:

I call this 'analysis' "unfortunate" because it doesn't generate any insight. I mean, what are you really supposed to get from this? One takeaway for the practitioner of text analysis is that you might have to do a decent amount of preprocessing before you can make impactful deliverables. Two useful ways you can preprocess raw text here are lemmatizing and using a parts-of-speech tagger to extract only nouns. What both of those steps share is the winnowing out (or consolidating) of noise/chaff. Let's test that out and see if my hunches are right:

[Coming soon: lemmas, nouns only as promised]

## Sentiment Analysis

I think most listeners of The Ezra Klein Show have noticed that Ezra is unique among interviewers in his emotionality. Not emotionality in a histrionic sense, but more like "general emotional urgency." I'm not sure I like that term (and I don't think it conveys anything to someone unfamiliar with the podcast), but I'll leave it there as a placeholder for now.

Andrew Heiss's [data visualization course](https://datavizs21.classes.andrewheiss.com/) inspired (and enabled) me to have nice(ish) looking text on my graphs. If you know some `ggplot2` and are looking to become high-intermediate in your `ggplot2` skills, I highly recommend his course.

The vast majority of the text analysis routines I learned back in the day from Julia Silge and Dave Robinson's [*Tidy Text Mining with R*](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) book. I recommend it to anyone as a jumping off point for doing text analysis. Most of the analyses here don't go (too far) beyond what you can do with the tools you pick up in that book.
