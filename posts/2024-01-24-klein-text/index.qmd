## Welcome

This page is a small (and incomplete!) labor of love. For now, it's part of an application to be the researcher for the Ezra Klein Show. With time it will morph into a much longer and more thorough guided tour of text analysis and politics.

## Interviewing Style

Before even looking at the content of the episodes, before looking at what words are said, sentiments are expressed and topics are covered, we can look at volume of speaking.

We can also compare this distribution of how much Ezra speaks as interviewer to how much other interviewers speak. After all, it's hard to really feel what the numbers in the graph above mean without comparing them to the relative talkativeness of other interviewers. Below is a comparison of Ezra with two other interviewers, both of whom have had Ezra on as a guest on their programs: Rob Wiblin (80,000 Hours) and Tyler Cowen (Conversations with Tyler).

## Ezra's Words

Alright, so what does this ingenious interviewer from Irvine actually talk about? Among the ways of answering that question, one is to just look at the words he uses.

We can also look at how he uses words differentially. Why would that be useful? Well, just looking at the words he uses might tell us that he's a guy with a show that covers topics X, Y, and Z that use the words associated with those topics.^[If we wanted a topic analysis we'd head down to the last section of this page!] One way we can "control for" topic is to contrast Ezra's words with those of his guest. Abstractly, the idea is that if person A and B are talking about subject S, the words that differentiate A and B are *not* going to be those that generically describe subject S. Rather, they will be the words idiosyncratically associated with each interlocutor.

## Sentiment Analysis

I think most listeners of The Ezra Klein Show have noticed that Ezra is unique among interviewers in his emotionality. Not emotionality in a histrionic sense, but more like "general emotional urgency." I'm not sure I like that term (and I don't think it conveys anything to someone unfamiliar with the podcast), but I'll leave it there as a placeholder for now.
